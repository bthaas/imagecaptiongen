# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Image Caption Generator is an end-to-end deep learning application that automatically generates natural language captions for uploaded images. The system uses a CNN + LSTM architecture built with TensorFlow to analyze images and produce descriptive text captions. The application features a FastAPI backend deployed on Google Cloud and a React frontend that supports real-time image upload and caption generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload an image through a web interface, so that I can receive an automatically generated caption describing the image content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the web application THEN the system SHALL display an image upload interface
2. WHEN a user selects an image file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
3. WHEN a user uploads a valid image THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the uploaded image
4. WHEN the image is processed THEN the system SHALL generate and display a natural language caption
5. WHEN the caption generation is complete THEN the system SHALL display the result within 10 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to generate accurate and descriptive captions, so that I can understand what is depicted in my images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is processed THEN the system SHALL use a CNN + LSTM architecture for caption generation
2. WHEN generating captions THEN the system SHALL produce grammatically correct English sentences
3. WHEN processing common objects and scenes THEN the system SHALL achieve reasonable accuracy in object identification
4. WHEN multiple objects are present THEN the system SHALL describe the most prominent elements in the image
5. IF the image quality is poor THEN the system SHALL still attempt to generate a basic caption

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and reliable caption generation, so that I can efficiently process multiple images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL begin processing within 2 seconds
2. WHEN the model processes an image THEN the system SHALL return results within 10 seconds for standard resolution images
3. WHEN the system is under normal load THEN the API SHALL maintain 99% uptime
4. WHEN multiple users access the system simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests without degradation
5. IF the system encounters an error THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured API backend, so that the system can be easily maintained and extended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is deployed THEN the system SHALL use FastAPI framework
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted JSON responses
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and logging
4. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL load the pre-trained TensorFlow model
5. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL validate input data and handle edge cases

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and intuitive web interface, so that I can easily interact with the caption generation system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, responsive React interface
2. WHEN uploading images THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback during processing
3. WHEN captions are generated THEN the system SHALL display results in a clear, readable format
4. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality and usability
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states and error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application deployed on Google Cloud, so that it can scale and be reliably accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL run on Google Cloud Platform
2. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale to handle load
3. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL be accessible via a public URL
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN it SHALL provide logs and metrics for debugging
5. IF the system fails THEN it SHALL automatically restart and recover

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manually verify each development step, so that I can ensure system quality and catch issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each development milestone is completed THEN the system SHALL be manually tested for functionality
2. WHEN integration points are implemented THEN the system SHALL be verified to ensure no regressions
3. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL be tested end-to-end before proceeding
4. WHEN issues are discovered during manual testing THEN they SHALL be resolved before continuing development
5. WHEN each component is completed THEN it SHALL be validated independently before integration
